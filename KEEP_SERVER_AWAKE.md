### Solution 3: Add a Health Check Endpoint (Optional Enhancement)

You can add a simple health check endpoint that responds quickly. This is already in your code, but here's how to verify it:

Your backend already has:
```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('✅ TripSync backend running'));
```

This endpoint is perfect for keep-alive pings!

---

### Solution 4: Use Multiple Free Services (Backup)

For maximum reliability, you can use **multiple services**:

1. **UptimeRobot** - Primary (every 5 minutes)
2. **cron-job.org** - Backup (every 10 minutes)
3. **Pingdom** (if available) - Additional backup

This ensures if one service fails, others keep the server awake.

   curl https://track-trips.onrender.com
   ```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Free Tier Limitations:**
   - Render free tier: 15-minute spin-down
   - UptimeRobot free: 5-minute minimum interval
   - cron-job.org free: Limited to certain intervals

2. **First Request After Spin-Down:**
   - Even with keep-alive, if server spins down, first request takes 30-60 seconds

   - Pinging every 5 minutes is well within limits
   - No issues expected
